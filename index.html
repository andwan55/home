                                        The research program teaches students how to design research questions and implement projects to answer them. 
                                        Students will work on projects that integrate data science with other fields such as biology, economics, social sciences, 
                                        political science, or any other field of interest. The program also includes college planning workshops and guest lectures 
                                        by Columbia professors. By participating in this program, students will create publish-worthy, novel projects.

                                        This course covers the basic core data structures built into python. 
                                        We will go through the syntax, the different available functions, and when to utilize each 
                                        data structure. The end goal is for each student to build a project they are passionate 
                                        about using the concepts learned in class. Note: We will avoid somewhat obscure and underused 
                                        data types, and instead focus on the ones which are most crucial for projects at a beginner level.

                                    high school career. The hands-on training I received in data science and AI allowed me to explore my interests 
                                    and develop valuable skills that I showcased on my college applications. Through my research project, I learned 
                                    to think critically and solve complex problems, which not only helped me gain admission to a top-tier college but 
                                    also prepared me for success in my academic and professional pursuits. I am so grateful for the mentorship and guidance 
                                    I received from the program, and I highly recommend it to any high school student who wants to explore the exciting world 
                                    of data science.</p>

                        <p>The Marvel Research Program (MRP) is a computer science research-focused organization, though we offer instructional courses in 
                            fundamental CS subjects as well. We offer high school students an opportunity to explore topics they are passionate about while guiding

                        <h2>FAQ</h2>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>How will the courses be delivered? Is it remote or is there any housing involved?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            All of our courses, including the research program, are fully remote. They will be delivered over call (i.e. Zoom or Google Meet)
                            and all class content will be in a Google Classroom. Communication may also be sent through our organization email.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>Do students in the research program get a certificate? How are they recognized?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            Students who complete the research program and write a full paper will have a high chance to have their paper officially published
                            and will be given a certificate of participation.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>What will the students in the research program be working on exactly? What is the nature of the research?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            In the research program, we will guide students in conducting novel research on a topic of their choosing, utilizing computer science 
                            concepts and tools to gather their data. This work is interdisciplinary in nature and as such has greater potential to stand out.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>If students cannot make the regular scheduled sessions for a course, are there any accomodations available?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            Of course! We want to support your student as much as possible - please just let us know what your schedule is, and we will do our best 
                            to work out separate calls to keep them on track. There will also be office hours available with the instructors of each course 
                            respectively.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>Are there any requirements to participating in a given course?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            The Intro to Python & Data Science course does not have any prerequisites, but the research program does have a few. Please refer to 
                            their info cards above for specifics. 
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>Does my child need to have already thought of an idea for research to participate in the research program?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            No, they do not need to have already come up with an idea for their research. We will spend the beginning of the research program 
                            helping students choose a topic and verifying that every student's choice, whether already chosen before the program or not, has the 
                            potential to become a full fledged paper.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>How much work will be involved in the research program on my child's part?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            A student in the research program can expect anywhere from 6-8 hours worth of work per week, in our 15 week session. This number may 
                            be higher or lower depending on the topic chosen, but the program is intended to be intensive and may ramp up in workload near the end. 
                            The instructors are here to provide guidance and advice on how to approach gathering the research, and the work ultimately rests on 
                            the student to be seen through.
