                                        The research program teaches students how to design research questions and implement projects to answer them. 
                                        Students will work on projects that integrate data science with other fields such as biology, economics, social sciences, 
                                        political science, or any other field of interest. The program also includes college planning workshops and guest lectures 
                                        by Columbia professors. By participating in this program, students will create publish-worthy, novel projects.

                                        This course covers the basic core data structures built into python. 
                                        We will go through the syntax, the different available functions, and when to utilize each 
                                        data structure. The end goal is for each student to build a project they are passionate 
                                        about using the concepts learned in class. Note: We will avoid somewhat obscure and underused 
                                        data types, and instead focus on the ones which are most crucial for projects at a beginner level.

                                        This course covers the fundamental concepts and techniques 
                                        needed to suceed in AP Computer Science, USA Computing Olympiad, and for CS Internships. 
                                        Students will learn about data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues,
                                        sorting, searching, recursion, and binary trees. The course focuses on developing practical 
                                        skills in programming for acing programming challenges. Students will attain a solid understanding 
                                        of data structures and implementing them into their own projects.

                                        This course covers topics such as data preprocessing, 
                                        data visualization, model selection, and evaluation. Students will use popular 
                                        machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to build and deploy 
                                        machine learning models in real-world applications. The models covered include 
                                        Random Forests, CNNs, neural networks, and more. By the end of the course, 
                                        students will have practical experience building and deploying machine learning 
                                        applications in a variety of settings.

                        <h2>FAQ</h2>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>How will the courses be delivered? Is it remote or is there any housing involved?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            All of our courses, including the research program, are fully remote. They will be delivered over call (i.e. Zoom or Google Meet)
                            and all class content will be in a Google Classroom.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>Do students in the research program get a certificate? How are they recognized?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            Students who complete the research program and write a full paper will have a high chance to have their paper officially published
                            and will be given a certificate of participation.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>What will the students in the research program be working on exactly? What is the nature of the research?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            In the research program, we will guide students in conducting novel research on a topic of their choosing, utilizing computer science 
                            concepts and tools to gather their data. This work is interdisciplinary in nature and as such has greater potential to stand out.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>If students cannot make the regular scheduled sessions for a course, are there any accomodations available?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            Of course! We want to support your student as much as possible - please just let us know what your schedule is, and we will do our best 
                            to work out separate calls to keep them on track. There will also be office hours available with the instructors of each course 
                            respectively.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>Are there any requirements to participating in a given course?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            The intro courses do not have any prerequisites, but the advanced courses and the research program do have a few. Please refer to 
                            their info cards above for specifics. 
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>Does my child need to have already thought of an idea for research to participate in the research program?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            No, they do not need to have already come up with an idea for their research. We will spend the beginning of the research program 
                            helping students choose a topic and verifying that every student's choice, whether already chosen before the program or not, has the 
                            potential to become a full fledged paper.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="entry-title"><a>How much work will be involved in the research program on my child's part?</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            A student in the research program can expect anywhere from 20-30 hours worth of work per week, in our 3.5 week session. This number may 
                            be higher or lower depending on the topic chosen, but the program is intended to be intensive. The instructors are here to provide 
                            guidance and advice on how to approach gathering the research, and the work ultimately rests on the student to be seen through.

                                    <p>Participating in the Marvel Research Program was one of the most transformative experiences of my 
                                    high school career. The hands-on training I received in data science and AI allowed me to explore my interests 
                                    and develop valuable skills that I showcased on my college applications. Through my research project, I learned 
                                    to think critically and solve complex problems, which not only helped me gain admission to a top-tier college but 
                                    also prepared me for success in my academic and professional pursuits. I am so grateful for the mentorship and guidance 
                                    I received from the program, and I highly recommend it to any high school student who wants to explore the exciting world 
                                    of data science.</p>
