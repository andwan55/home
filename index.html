                                        of their essays to provide schools with a better idea of who the student is.

                                        This program prepares students for competitive programming and interview questions! We’ll cover various 
                                        data structures, algorithms, and strategies to complete challenging problems in an efficient manner. We 
                                        will provide pseudo-code and try to gain a deep understanding of not just how to utilize each algorithm, 
                                        but how exactly they work. Finally, we’ll provide great practice questions to hone your skills and gain more exposure!

                                    <p>…the program was an amazing learning experience. I particularly liked how our research project was sometimes 
                                        interspersed with guest speakers that helped us get more clarity on what we potentially want to do in the future. 
                                        Also, the instructors were always there to suggest ideas and papers— they made the research process intuitive and 
                                        interesting!</p>

                        <p>The Marvel Research Program (MRP) is a computer science research-focused organization, though we offer instructional courses in 
                            fundamental CS subjects as well. We offer high school students an opportunity to explore topics they are passionate about while guiding 
                            them in conducting research in those fields using CS tools, often involving the use of machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence 
                            (AI). Our program is fully remote and is designed for all high school students, including rising freshmen and recent high school graduates. 
                            Though we are based in the US and mainly operate on a nationwide basis, we also consider international applicants as well. ALL CLASSES 
                            OPERATE ON PST (Pacific Standard Time).</p>

                                A student in the research program can expect anywhere from 6-8 hours worth of work per week, in our 12 week session. This number may 
                                be higher or lower depending on the topic chosen, but the program is intended to be intensive and may ramp up in workload near the end. 
                                The instructors are here to provide guidance and advice on how to approach gathering the research, and the work ultimately rests on 
                                the student to be seen through.
